===========

Android app to play the game of go on the DGS servers.
Follow below links for more information:

* For installation via F-Droid: [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=dragongoapp&fdid=fr.xtof54.dragonGoApp) (you have to enable the archive F-droid repositories)

* You can also compile it quite easily, because it does not depend on any compilation framework/IDE: it has minimal and simple libraries, and compilation is done only with the build.sh script. So you just need to adapt the build.sh script with the correct path to your android SDK, create a signing key and write the passphrase on jarsigner.password, and run the script.
